# Ethereum
## HYPE4 recruitment task

Based on the InVision project, create deskop and phone resolution Ethereum markup. Assume that the desktop is up to 1200px resolution, and the phone is below 768px. In resolutions between these two values, the element should occupy the entire width of the screen (possibly with small margins).

The goal of the task is to make two elements of the presented type that should look good on the latest versions of popular browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, Safari, IE11).
